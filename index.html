			<h2>About Me</h2>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p class="about-text">
				Hello, My name is Advay Sanketi and I am currently pursuing my BTech in Computer Science at PES University in Bengaluru.
				<br>
				Born into a South Indian Air Force Family, I grew up to love 3 things - food for my body, food for thought, and coding.
				<br>
				<br>
				For me code is more than just a set of instructions - it's a powerful tool that enables us not only to explore amazing opportunities but also to create new possibilities allowing for a future with a higher promise - A vision worthy of working towards. I started programming when I was 13 - 14 years old. I have grown a lot since then and my coding arsenal now includes many programming languages, softwares and frameworks. I'm always expanding my skills, and I'm excited to see where my coding journey will take me next 😆.
				<br>
				<br>
				I also enjoy listening to music, watching South Indian movies, Staying Fit like the heroes in those South Indian Films and reading about really interesting stuff like - Lumination Encoding, Evolutionary Algorithms, the Dreamer Algorithm, Conway's Game of Life (Check these topics out, they're amazing 😋)
				<br>
				<br>
